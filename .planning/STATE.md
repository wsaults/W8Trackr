## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Bug fixes only, no new features for this milestone
- [Init]: HealthKit import deferred to P2
- [01-01]: Check uncelebrated milestones first before new achievements (handles crash recovery)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Duplicate HealthKit managers (HealthKitManager vs HealthSyncManager) may complicate QUAL-01
- Unit tests have pre-existing infrastructure issues (0.000s runtime suggests test setup problems, not assertion failures)
