## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| RTL layout support | Requires significant UI refactoring, defer to v1.3+ |
| Professional translation | AI translations first, iterate on user feedback |
| Regional variants | Use generic locale codes (zh, fr, de) not region-specific |
| Traditional Chinese | Simplified covers largest market, add Traditional later |
| In-app language override | Rely on system language setting |
